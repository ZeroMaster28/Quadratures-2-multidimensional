# Quadratures-2-multidimensional
2nd project for Numerical Analysis Classses

Monte Carlo method is very intuitive and powerful tool while dealing with various numerical tasks.
One of them is numerical integration of multivariate functions such as f: R^n->R as well as integration
with n=1 where function is not necessarily continuous (classical quadratures may fail).

Whole concept works because of strong law of large numbers, so the solutions are quite non deterministic.
Error, in fact, depends on what probability density function we use. However, for large sample we get pretty neat results.

Negative aspect of this method is brought by convergence which in this case is slower than for typical quadratures.
Nevertheless, implementation is not complicated.

This is a test.
